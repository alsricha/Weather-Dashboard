User Story

As a user who checks the weather everyday, I want to open up an application search for a specific city by name or by city, state and get today's current weather as well as a 5 day forecast. In addition to showing the current weather, the application will display temperature, humidity, UV index, and a picture representing whether it is clear, cloudy, raining, etc. 

Intention

* Build my first application using an API and retrieve data from a third-party weather applicaiton (OpenWeather API) using their API to pull in information of a city current and 5 day forecast.
